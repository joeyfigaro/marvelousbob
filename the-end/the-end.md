The End.
“I remember when Laura died, the look on your face, it was priceless!  You were just ‘too late’.  Oh, and I thought it was dream, remember?  I didn’t know, and you couldn’t find me because I didn’t know!”

As he talks his suit, his stupid, expensive Italian suit changes.  A series of stupid costumes flicker in and out of existence, he’s in a flux, and he doesn’t even know it.

I’m pinned to the side of a building and I’m probably going to die.

Nice suit, Frank.

What can I say?  I’m a sarcastic bastard.

He scowls.

“Because you always win.”

What the fuck is he talking about now?

That doesn’t make any sense.

“Sure it does.  At first I just hated you, and I guess that hate made me do things, but, the reason for hating you, that’s the best part, see, the reason was that you always win.”

Frankie, you’re sick.

“Maybe I am, that’s really not your problem right now, is it Bob?”

There’s a pause, and I see a little piece of my brother.

“Don’t call me Frankie, Bubba.”

Then that piece dies.

I can feel him tear my leg off, and it hurt more than I ever thought anything could.

It’s a slow pain, not a quick one, I guess he’s doing that, too.

He’s not just my match, he’s my better.

And I need help.

That’s when I feel it.  Deep inside me, I know what I have to do.

I always hated this kind of thing, it’s so obvious, the last ditch effort that fixes the problem but kills the hero.

And I guess I’m the hero.

So be it.

I can feel my life drain out of me, it’s fast and it’s painless, but for some reason I remain “alive” long enough to feel my powers seep into everyone in the city.

In a city of people with powers, Frankie,  you’re outmatched and outgunned.

And I make my final play.

“Hey, Frankie, I win.”

Before I die, my last thoughts are of Grace, and that I hope she’s proud of me and I wonder if I’ll see her and if there’s a heaven.

Then it all goes bright, and I see everything at once.
